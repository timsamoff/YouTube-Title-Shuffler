# YouTube Title Shuffler

A Google Chrome Extension by Tim Samoff.

## Description

### Change your perspective...
Lately, scrolling through my video feed on YouTube has been an emotional minefield. The headlines and thumbnails present a barrage of negativity and sensationalism — I’m sure you’ve felt it too.

So, I decided to flip the script. Literally.

To give myself something to smile about, I built a simple Chrome extension that turns my YouTube homepage into a source of absurdity rather than anxiety. It’s a small pleasure, but it makes me laugh whenever I open the site.

#### What does the extension do?

It’s called **YouTube Title Shuffler**, and it does exactly that: it randomly swaps video titles on your home page.

Imagine a thumbnail of a news segment featuring the current president and a certain tech billionaire, but the title reads, *“How I Make My Grandmother’s Egg Drop Soup.”* Or an image of an outraged person screaming about something they feel (too) strongly about labeled *“Top 10 Reasons Why My Cat is Smarter Than Me.”*

And it gets even better — if the extension can’t find a title to shuffle, it adds a completely random (and most likely silly) quote instead. Picture a glassy pond with a lone duck gracefully floating upon the pristine water, accompanied by the words: *“Do. Or do not. There is no try.”* Pure comedy gold, I tell you!

#### Want to try it out?

The extension is currently under review for the Chrome Web Store, but you can install it manually right now:

 1. Download **youtube_title_shuffler.zip** and unzip it.*
 2. In Chrome, click the **Extensions** icon (the puzzle piece at the top right of the browser interface) and select Manage Extensions.
 3. Enable **Developer Mode** (the toggle at the top right).
 4. Click **Load Unpacked** (the button at the top left).
 5. Navigate to the unzipped **youtube_title_shuffler** folder and click **Select**.
 6. Go to the **YouTube** website and enjoy! :)

(Of course, this will be much simpler if it passes the review process.)*

#### Change Your Perspective. Be Happy.

Give it a try and let me know what you think — I’d love your feedback!
